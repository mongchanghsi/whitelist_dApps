# Whitelist dApps

## What is it

This is a Whitelist dApps which whitelists the user upon clicking a button with a maximum of 10 users. This is part of the Web3 tutorial from [LearnWeb3.io](https://www.learnweb3.io/tracks/sophomore/whitelist-dapp).

You can check the deployed smart contract on rinkeby here: [https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xb825c3cccf892E2643301B9833267c47AA691Ec2#code](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xb825c3cccf892E2643301B9833267c47AA691Ec2#code)

## Future works

- To write tests for smart contract
- To write frontend to interact with the smart contract
